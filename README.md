## Abstract
Using Neuroarch to create creative arcichecture. The idea of the NeuroArch research project was, firstly, to explore the possibilities of generating new images based on existing ones, secondly, to explore the methodology of applying generative machine learning for creative tasks and design, and finally, to give a critical assessment of visual culture. I would like to use the architecture of the WP-GAN neural network to generate this images. I think it can be intersting to use deep learning to create building architecture. 
## Model/Data

Analyzing the samples thousands of times (in NeuroArch 110,000 learning epochs), the neural network algorithm learns to extract characteristic features from the samples, forming the so-called a feature space in which features are grouped as model parameters.

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results
t can be assumed that the generated images have a special aesthetics that makes them related to works of abstract artistic trends such as Cubism or Expressionism.



## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
