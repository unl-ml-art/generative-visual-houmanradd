## Abstract
Using Neuroarch to create creative arcichecture. The idea of the NeuroArch research project was, firstly, to explore the possibilities of generating new images based on existing ones, secondly, to explore the methodology of applying generative machine learning for creative tasks and design, and finally, to give a critical assessment of visual culture. I would like to use the architecture of the WP-GAN neural network to generate this images. I think it can be intersting to use deep learning to create building architecture. 
## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
